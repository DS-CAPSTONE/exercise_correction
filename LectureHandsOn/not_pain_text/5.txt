Scenario 4: "I’ve been dealing with pain in so many places, it’s hard to keep track. My lower back is constantly sore, and it hurts to sit for too long. My knees are in bad shape—walking or even standing for more than a few minutes makes them feel like they’re going to give out. My hands have been cramping up a lot lately, especially in the mornings, and my fingers sometimes feel numb. It’s frustrating because my shoulders and neck have been stiff too. I try stretching, but nothing seems to help. Even my hips ache when I try to lie down at night, and sometimes I wake up with this terrible pain in my jaw like I’ve been grinding my teeth. Everything feels like it’s falling apart."
