Scenario 2: "I can't stand this pain anymore. My wrists are constantly sore, like a burning sensation every time I move them, especially when I type or use my phone. My fingers are getting stiff too. Then there’s my hips, which hurt so bad that it’s difficult to sleep on my side. If I stand for too long, the pain shoots down my legs, making my ankles throb. The worst part is my stomach—this gnawing pain that comes and goes, but when it hits, I have to curl up in a ball. Even my jaw aches, like I've been clenching my teeth, but I don't even realize I'm doing it. Everything just hurts."
