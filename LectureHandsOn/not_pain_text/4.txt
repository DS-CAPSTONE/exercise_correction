Scenario 3: "Every morning I wake up with pain in my lower back, like something’s stabbing me right in the spine. By midday, my legs start to hurt too. It's this deep ache in my calves and thighs, and sometimes it feels like my muscles are about to cramp up. My shoulders feel so tense that even moving them slightly sends pain down my arms. My feet have this burning sensation after walking, and to top it off, my hands feel weak and tingly. My neck feels like it’s always stiff, and I’m constantly massaging it just to get some relief, but nothing really helps. And my migraines… those just make everything worse. It’s like I can’t escape this pain, no matter what I do."
