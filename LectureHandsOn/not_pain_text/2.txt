Scenario 1: "I've been in so much pain lately. My back has been killing me, especially the lower part. It feels like a constant dull ache, but every time I bend over or try to lift something, it turns into this sharp, shooting pain that goes all the way down my legs. My neck is also stiff, and sometimes I get these awful headaches that seem to radiate from the base of my skull. On top of that, my knees have been acting up—there’s this grinding sensation every time I walk up the stairs. It’s unbearable, and I’ve noticed my right shoulder is starting to hurt when I try to reach for things. I don't know what’s going on, but it feels like my entire body is breaking down."
